#StableSeating
First of all, this code is terribly programmed, barely commented and the architecture is just bad - and I am too lazy to change it. But, it works :)
The task is to seat 4n people in 4 x n in the best possible manner efficiently. Trying to get the best total sum of preference numbers is too time taking so instead I try to seat them stably in O(n^2). A pair x and y are stable if for x there doesn't exist another z who likes x more than y and z also likes x more than it's current partner (Therefore, x and z would rather sit with each other). In this context, your neighbours should be stable in the same manner.
For this program, half the people must decide to sit in the 2 middle seats, and the other half in the 2 corner seats (in this version of the program the first half is automatically assigned middle seat). Next they must click the names in order of their preferences.
The program works by first matching each person sitting in the center with a corner person through Gale-shapely algorithm. This matching always exists since it is a bipartide graph. I call this a partially stable seating (because every person is at least stably seated with one of it's neighbours). 
Then the program attempts to match these pairs (to produce a row of 4) using Irving's algorithm. Since this is a complete graph, this fully stable seating may or may not exist.
